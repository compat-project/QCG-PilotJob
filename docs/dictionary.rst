  are static and do not change in time

QCG-PilotJob Manager
  A service started inside a scheduling system allocation that schedules and controls execution of jobs on the same
  allocation

QCG-PilotJob Manager API
  An interface in the form of Python module that provides communication with QCG-PilotJob Manager

Application Controller
  A user's program run as one of jobs inside QCG-PilotJob Manager that, using the QCG-PilotJob Manager API, dynamically
