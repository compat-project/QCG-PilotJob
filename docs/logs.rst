Log files
=========

QCG-PilotJob Manager creates a sub directory `.qcgpjm-service-` in working directory where the following files are
stored:

- ``service.log`` - logs of QCG-PilotJob Manager, very useful in case of problems
- ``jobs.report`` - the file containing information about all finished jobs, by default written in text format, but
  there is an option for JSON format which will be easier to parse
- ``final_status`` - created at the finish of QCG-PilotJob Manager with general statistics about platform, available
  resources and jobs in registry (not removed) that finished, failed etc.

The verbosity of log file can be controlled by the ``--log`` parameter where ``debug`` value is the most verbose mode,
and ``critical`` the most silent mode. We recommend to not set the ``debug`` for large HTC workflows, as it additionally
loads the file system.
